<h2>üóúÔ∏è Tensor Decomposition for Deep Neural Network Compression</h2>
*Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, TensorLy, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy*

<div style="text-align: justify;">
In this graduate-level research project, I was the lead researcher on exploring tensor decomposition techniques to optimize the compression of deep neural networks, addressing the challenge of executing data-heavy processes on low-power/edge devices with limited memory capacity. By investigating the impact of tensor shapes and parameter folding on compression and accuracy, I developed an optimization algorithm aimed at maximizing the compression ratio. The study demonstrates how reshaping high-order tensors and extracting latent information can effectively reduce computational requirements, enabling universal application across various neural network architectures and use cases.

<h2>üß¨ Using Fluorescence Nanosensors to Detect Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Deficiency</h2>
*Figma, Quantitative Analysis, Scientific Research & Presentation*

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is essential for neurological function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis, with deficiencies affecting over 3 million people annually in the US, leading to symptoms like muscle weakness and memory loss. We introduce an innovative solution using F√∂rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) fluorescence-based nanosensors for rapid and accessible detection. Our device operates similarly to a glucose meter: a small blood sample is analyzed using nanosensors designed to detect the unique cobalt structure of B<sub>12</sub> and associated deficiency markers like high methylmalonic acid levels. The process involves nanomaterials binding specifically to cobalt in Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, followed by activation of cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) through FRET. This generates a numerical output and a fluorescence-based indicator, allowing patients to gauge B<sub>12</sub> levels and seek appropriate medical treatment.
