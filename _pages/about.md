Interests and Background
======

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    My professional interests lie in software engineering, data engineering/analytics, and engineering consulting. I hope to develop innovative tools used both in-house and in consumer-based markets, advancing technological innovation to benefit the world!

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    My research interests lie in machine learning, human-computer interaction, and neural network optimization. I was able to explore these topics during my time as a lead researcher in the <a href="https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at UCSB, and also as a Machine Learning Intern for the startup <a href="https://www.ore.green/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; font-weight: bold;">ORE</a>.

    I recently finished a contracted project <a href="https://gomomentus.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Momentus Technologies</a>, an event management software company where I analyzed various revenue streams and customer satisfaction scores based on product feature usage, and provided data-backed visualizations through engineering linear regression models in how Momentus could enhance user engagement and drive client revenue growth. This past summer, I was working with <a href="https://gkadvisors.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Global Key Advisors</a>, an advisory firm, as a qualitative analyst intern, where I learned and implemented some really interesting methods in natural language processing to analyze companies' 10-K reports through conducting sentiment analysis within their MD&A sectors and generating predictions on their future performance.

Furthermore, I have worked as a technology analyst for <a href="https://qualcomm.com/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; font-weight: bold;">Qualcomm</a> to help improve user traction for their online course offerings, merging my passion for software and UI/UX development with a more client-focused approach.
